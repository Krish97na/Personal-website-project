                    <h3>Recommendations for the Development of Trustworthy(er) Autonomous Systems</h3>
                    <p> Complying with the EU AI Act (AIA) guidelines while developing and implementing AI systems will soon be mandatory within the EU. However, practitioners lack actionable instructions to operationalise ethics during AI systems development. A literature review of different ethical guidelines revealed inconsistencies in the principles addressed and the terminology used to describe them. Furthermore, requirements engineering (RE), which is identified to foster trustworthiness in the AI development process from the early stages was observed to be absent in a lot of frameworks that support the development of ethical and trustworthy AI. This incongruous phrasing combined with a lack of concrete development practices makes trustworthy AI development harder. To address this concern, we formulated a comparison table for the terminology used and the coverage of the ethical AI principles in major ethical AI guidelines. We then examined the applicability of ethical AI development frameworks for performing effective RE during the development of trustworthy AI systems. A tertiary review and meta-analysis of literature discussing ethical AI frameworks revealed their limitations when developing trustworthy AI. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations to address such limitations during the development of trustworthy AI. </p>

                    <h3> Towards an AI-centric Requirements Engineering Framework for Trustworthy AI </h3>
                    <p> Ethical guidelines are an asset for artificial intelligence(AI) development and conforming to them will soon be a procedural requirement once the EU AI Act gets ratified in the European parliament. However, developers often lack explicit knowledge on how to apply these guidelines during the system development process. A literature review of different ethical guidelines from various countries and organizations has revealed inconsistencies in the principles presented and the terminology used to describe such principles. This research begins by identifying the limitations of existing ethical AI development frameworks in performing requirements engineering (RE) processes during the development of trustworthy AI. Recommendations to address those limitations will be proposed to make the frameworks more applicable in the RE process to foster the development of trustworthy AI. This could lead to wider adoption, greater productivity of the AI systems, and reduced workload on humans for non-cognitive tasks. Considering the impact of some of the newer foundation models like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, the vision for this research project is to work towards the development of holistic operationalisable RE guidelines for the development and implementation of trustworthy AI not only on a product level but also on process level.</p>

                    <h3> Is Prompt Engineering the Future of Requirements Engineering? </h3>
                    <p> The current state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing for Requirements Engineering (NLP4RE) has a gap, which is the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating requirements. To address this issue, new techniques must be explored to enhance the quality of LLM-generated requirements. One practical approach that has emerged is Prompt Engineering (PE), which has been shown to significantly improve LLM performance. But the growing adoption of AI is expected to present a potential challenge to established cultural norms and will alter the human-AI interaction modality. Thus, it is imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of AI. Current research is focused on investigating different PE techniques to enhance LLM performance in RE tasks while also investigating ways to ensure the implementation of the AI in the RE tasks is done in a Trustworthy manner.</p>
